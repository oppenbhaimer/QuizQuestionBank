These ridiculously overpowered engines burned a large amount of fuel, nearly three times the amount allowed today. In 1984, FIA banned refuelling after a spate of pit stop fires. They also limited the maximum capacity of fuel tanks to 220 litres. Team were slow to adapt, leading to the farcical 1985 San Marino Grand Prix where more than half of the field ran out of fuel. As always, engineers found a loophole In the regulations by exploiting the vague phrasing of the rules. By utilizing a very basic physical property of liquids and running the fuel through a simple process, they were able to fill in more fuel in the cars than what the FIA thought they had allowed.

A decade after its release, the album began to attract wide praise from rock critics. Christgau wrote in his 1977 retrospective review for The Village Voice that the record had been difficult to understand in 1967, 'which is probably why people are still learning from it.
